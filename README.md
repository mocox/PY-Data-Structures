# Data Structues Using Python

<p>Python algorithms and data structures is a set of file to help understand algorithms and data structures.
Although these files are written in python the principles are the same for any language.
Just convert them to the language of your choice, javascript, C#, java etc.

    Although many languages encapsulate these algorithms into their packages / interpreters etc, its good to understand how these work.
